## Artifical Neural Network

the knight_tour.py explores the logic and mathemathics of the implementing an ANN in a closed knight's tour problem.
the gui_representation is the graphic user interface implementation of the knight_tour.py. This file will create an instance of the a Knight_tour from the knight_tour file and implement the solution into a graphical form. The code for this file will be edited extensivly as it is only helping the user have a visual perception of the knight's tour.

Disclaimer: the knight_tour.py is a significantly slower algorithm compared to other ANN programs.

knight.exe is a program which incorporates an enhanced logic behind the knight's tour. It not only solves solutions for non-hamiltonion circuits (paths and open tours), but will find solutions for hamiltonion circuits (closed tours).
